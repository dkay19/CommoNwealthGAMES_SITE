        <p>Sport underpins the unique connections and friendships which bring together a third of the world’s population as citizens of the nations and territories of the Commonwealth. For more than eight decades the Commonwealth Games Federation has taken a global leadership role in uniting the Commonwealth’s athletes, citizens and communities through the transformative and connecting power of sport.</p>
        <p>We're inspired by the diversity and dynamism of the Commonwealth itself - a voluntary association of 71 nations and territories - and its enduring commitment to human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Among our membership are some of the world’s largest and smallest countries, from India, with over 1.2 billion people to Niue with a population of 1,600.  More than 60% of the Commonwealth citizens are under 30.</p>
       <p>Today, the Commonwealth Games Federation is far more than the curator of a great Games. As a cornerstone of the Commonwealth itself, our dynamic sporting movement – driven by its values of Humanity, Equality and Destiny – has a key role to play in an energised, engaged and active Commonwealth of Nations and Territories. And with new members joining, a hugely successful Gold Coast 2018 , preparations for Birmingham 2022 well underway, the Commonwealth is entering an era of renewed relevance.</p>
